Summary: Following along with Brad and Florin doing 50 JavaScript projects to get better at JavaScript. In this project we created an animation that pops in boxes of content as you scroll down the page. I've seen this before on websites where as you scroll certain content, testimonials, featured content pop in from right and left and either disappear as you go up or stay loaded in as you scroll up. Not much new HTML and CSS wise but in JS I used the window.addEventListener event for the first time, we created a function that as you scroll it pops them in and out using getBoundingClientRect() which I've never heard of before. Also used logic with an if statement that triggers the up and down so it's not a gumbled mess of divs all over the place. Simple project but already thinking how to utilize this in a portfolio website with bringing in content as the user scrolls.
